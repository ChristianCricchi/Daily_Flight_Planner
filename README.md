# **Daily Flight Planner**

Daily Flight Planner is an application designed for the aviation industry, especially for operations/dispatchers, that allows the planning and assignment of daily flights at an airport to various dispatchers. There are two types of login with two different levels of privileges:

AdminOps Account:

- Home: Access to view daily flights and the privilege to edit and delete already dispatched flights and perform a search by name or flight number in the database.
- About: Access to a description of the app and a glossary of terms and abbreviations used in the app.
- Report: Ability to create and edit flight reports, similar to other users, as this is not an exclusive privilege of the AdminOps account because the Operations Manager will later review and archive the report definitively and store it for 90 days.
- Dispatch: Access to the names and IDs of dispatchers currently working at the airport, with the privilege to add, edit, and delete dispatch files.
- Register: Exclusive privilege to create login credentials for dispatchers.
- New Flight: Privilege to create and schedule daily flights.
This comprehensive access allows AdminOps to manage various aspects of flight operations efficiently.
- Log Out: Access to the Log Out page to sign out of their profile.

Dispatch Account:

- Home: Access to the home page where the dispatcher can view their daily flights and perform a search by name or flight number in the database.
