# **Daily Flight Planner**

Daily Flight Planner is an application designed for the aviation industry, especially for operations/dispatchers, that allows the planning and assignment of daily flights at an airport to various dispatchers. There are two types of User with two different levels of privileges:

AdminOps Account:

- Home: Access to view daily flights and the privilege to edit and delete already dispatched flights and perform a search by name or flight number in the database.
- About: Access to a description of the app and a glossary of terms and abbreviations used in the app.
- Report: Ability to create and edit flight reports, similar to other users, as this is not an exclusive privilege of the AdminOps account because the Operations Manager will later review and archive the report definitively and store it for 90 days.
- Dispatch: Access to the names and IDs of dispatchers currently working at the airport, with the privilege to add, edit, and delete dispatch files.
- Register: Exclusive privilege to create login credentials for dispatchers.
- New Flight: Privilege to create and schedule daily flights.
This comprehensive access allows AdminOps to manage various aspects of flight operations efficiently.
- Log Out: Access to the Log Out page to sign out of their profile.

Dispatch Account:

- Home: Access to the home page where the dispatcher can view their daily flights and perform a search by name or flight number in the database.
- About: Access to a description of the app and a glossary of terms and abbreviations used in the app.
- Report: Ability to create and edit flight reports, similar to other users, the Operations Manager will later review and archive the report definitively and store it for 90 days.
- Log Out: Access to the Log Out page to sign out of their profile.

## Deployment & Local Development

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select __New__ in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select __Create new app__ from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select __Create App__.
- From the new app __Settings__, click __Reveal Config Vars__, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's __requirements__ (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace __app.py__ with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

NOTE: The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end.

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select __Automatic Deployment__ from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

#### How to Fork

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ChristianCricchi/Daily_Flight_Planner)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

#### How to Clone

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChristianCricchi/Daily_Flight_Planner) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git shell or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/ChristianCricchi/Daily_Flight_Planner`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.
