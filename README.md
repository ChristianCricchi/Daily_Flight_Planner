# **Daily Flight Planner**

Daily Flight Planner is an application designed for the aviation industry, especially for operations/dispatchers, that allows the planning and assignment of daily flights at an airport to various dispatchers. There are two types of login access:
AdminOps:
- Home: Access to view daily flights and the privilege to edit and delete already dispatched flights.
- About: Access to a description of the app and a glossary of terms and abbreviations used in the app.
- Report: Ability to create and edit flight reports, similar to other users, as this is not an exclusive privilege of the AdminOps account. - The Operations Manager will later review and archive the report definitively.
- Dispatch: Access to the names and IDs of dispatchers currently working at the airport, with the privilege to add, edit, and delete dispatch files.
- Register: Exclusive privilege to create login credentials for dispatchers.
- New Flight: Privilege to create and schedule daily flights.
This comprehensive access allows AdminOps to manage various aspects of flight operations efficiently.
